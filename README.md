# Classifcation of graph-structred data using Gaussian boson sampling with thershold detectors
Repo for the code used to generate the data in the paper I authored *A Quantum Graph Kernel using Gaussian Boson Sampling with Threshold Detectors* forthcoming in the 
jounral Physical Review A.
The basic idea of the quantum machine learning algorithm is to encode the adjacancey matrix of a graph into a Gaussian boson sampler that measures photon detection events 
using thereshold detectors.
